# WIN 98 the game.
WIN-98 the game. is a simplistic escape room game with Windows 98 style graphics,

where you break glass (or doors) using the F-key. break one of the four doors on the map to win.

paradoxically enough you can not play this on windows or mac for that matter right now, you can only play it on linux with out a running window manager 
(or maybe use **ctrl + alt + f1-f12** to switch your tty to a fresh instance that is not running a wm).
